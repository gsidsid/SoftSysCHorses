#### What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

We aim to explore the potential of efficiency of using C through multithreading a program. We have chose K means as an appropriate algorithm for this. The MVP we plan to achieve is a working multithread function and then we shall expand by exploring the GPU implementation of the same

#### What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?

By working on this project, we hope to learn more about the general use and application of structs in C, as well as some more advanced techniques, such as the parallel and GPU processing of the K-means algorithm.

#### What have you done to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?  If you found any resources you think I should add to the list on the class web page, please email them to me.

We have looked at documentation and tutorials regarding multithreading and went through them. We then implemented K means on a single thread and read more about the mechanics of parallelizing it. We have also looked into documentation for the GPU implementation.

#### What are you working on now?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you are working on, and identify which members of the team are working on them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?

Right now, we have a minimum viable product for our implementation of K-means. Three tasks we are currently working on are:
Sid: Setting up CUDA development toolchain 
Kawin: Researching how to conduct parallel processing in C
Sree: Refactoring original codebase to support parallel processing
