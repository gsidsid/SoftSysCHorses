We aim to explore the potential of efficiency of using C through multithreading a program. We have chose K means as an appropriate algorithm for this. The MVP we plan to achieve is a working multithread function and then we shall expand by exploring the GPU implementation of the same

By working on this project, we hope to learn more about the general use and application of structs in C, as well as some more advanced techniques, such as the parallel and GPU processing of the K-means algorithm.

We have looked at documentation and tutorials regarding multithreading and went through them. We then implemented K means on a single thread and read more about the mechanics of parallelizing it. We have also looked into documentation for the GPU implementation.

Right now, we have a minimum viable product for our implementation of K-means. Three tasks we are currently working on are:
Sid: Setting up CUDA development toolchain 
Kawin: Researching how to conduct parallel processing in C
Sree: Refactoring original codebase to support parallel processing
