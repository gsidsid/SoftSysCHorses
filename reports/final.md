# Learning about Parallelism, Testing, and Build Systems
Kawin Nikomborirak, Siddarth Garimella, Sreekanth Sajjala

## Project Goals
Our goal for the project was to understand low-level optimization in C by exploring kmeans.
To do this, our tool of emphasis was parallelism via the POSIX threading library pthread and the semaphore library semaphore.
Since this would be a collaborative project, we also set out to explore various tools for project management, such as build systems (CMake), CI (travis), and unit testing (Google Tests).
